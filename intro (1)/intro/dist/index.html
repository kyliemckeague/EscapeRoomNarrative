<p>Welcome to a Night in the Museum (art museum of course!) You will be taking a night tour through our surrealist art exhibit. The room you will be escaping from is the Salvador Dali display. How much do you know about Dali and surrealism? The more you know, the quicker it will be to escape. Salvador Dali is a well known surrealist artist, known for his unusual paintings, sculptures, and films. Dali was extremely unique when it came to his art. Will you use your Persistence of Memory to explore these puzzles and games? What will be your outcome? What will be your tactics and strategies to survive the surreal? </p>
<p>	Surrealism art is characterized by an array of imagery, color choices, shapes, and techniques to create a dream affecting piece. Salvador Dali and many other surrealist painters participated in creating this dreamlike world by coming to terms with their unconscious mind, in other words superior reality. One of Dali’s infamous quotes were, “The difference between me and the surrealists, is that I am a surrealist.” He applied this unconscious mindset to his everyday life. Every piece of art, whether it be painting, sculpting, filming, fashion, designing, drawing, had an unique touch.</p>
